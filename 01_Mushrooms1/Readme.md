# Mushrooms
Codes and examples based on the book Data Science for Business by Foster Provost and Tom Fawcett.

Example on mushrooms of page 56 onward.

# Goal
Find out which properties of a mushroom correlate with its edibility.

# Problems
22 properties (color, odor, etc.)

# Issues during coding
1. It was not directly specified which column is the edible one - comparison of values suggested this to be the 1st column.
2. Calculation of entropy yielded slighty different values. As there is no further explanation in the book on how data is processed, this is a major concern. Has data been excluded? Is my implementation of entropy calculation wrong?

# Outcome
Due to missing explanations on how the result was obtained, I stopped continuing here after some elementary steps and continued to other, more thoroughly explained examples. With more knowledge on my side I will return here and continue.
